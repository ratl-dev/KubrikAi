# *KubrikAI: The Language Model for Data*  

> *“KubrikAI doesn’t just translate SQL – it tells the story your data is trying to whisper.”*

## ✨ Introduction  
- [What is KubrikAI?](#what-is-kubrikai)  
- [Why KubrikAI?](#why-kubrikai)

### What is KubrikAI?

KubrikAI is an advanced language model specifically designed for data operations and SQL intelligence. Built on a sophisticated Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, KubrikAI transforms natural language queries into precise, optimized SQL statements while understanding complex database schemas, business policies, and contextual relationships.

Unlike traditional SQL generators, KubrikAI goes beyond simple translation—it provides intelligent reasoning about your data, suggests optimizations, explains query logic, and ensures compliance with organizational policies.

### Why KubrikAI?

**🎯 Precision & Context**: KubrikAI understands not just what you want to query, but how your data is structured, what business rules apply, and what the most efficient approach would be.

**🧠 Expert Intelligence**: Our MoE architecture routes queries through specialized experts trained on different aspects of data operations—from schema understanding to performance optimization.

**🔒 Policy-Aware**: Built-in governance ensures that generated queries respect data access policies, privacy requirements, and compliance standards.

**🌐 Multi-Database**: Native support for multiple database systems with intelligent adaptation of syntax and optimization strategies.

**📈 Performance-First**: Every query is optimized for performance, considering indexes, query execution plans, and resource utilization.

## 🔍 Prompting & Fine-tuning  
- [🧠 Prompt Patterns](#prompt-patterns)  
- [🛠️ Fine-tuning Guidelines](#fine-tuning-guidelines)

### 🧠 Prompt Patterns

Optimize your queries with effective prompt patterns:

**Specific Context**:
```
"In our e-commerce database, show me customers who have placed orders worth more than $500 in the last 30 days, grouped by their registration source"
```

**Domain-Specific Language**:
```
"Calculate customer lifetime value using the cohort analysis method, 
considering only active customers from the past year"
```

**Complex Analytical Patterns**:
```
"Perform a funnel analysis from product view to purchase, 
broken down by traffic source and customer segment, 
with conversion rates at each step"
```

### 🛠️ Fine-tuning Guidelines

Customize KubrikAI for your specific domain:

**1. Prepare Domain Data**
```python
from kubrikai.training import FineTuner

# Prepare your domain-specific query-SQL pairs
training_data = [
    ("Show me our top sellers", "SELECT p.name, SUM(oi.quantity) as total_sold FROM products p JOIN order_items oi ON p.id = oi.product_id GROUP BY p.name ORDER BY total_sold DESC LIMIT 10;"),
    # ... more examples
]

fine_tuner = FineTuner(model="kubrikai-base")
fine_tuner.prepare_data(training_data)
```

**2. Configure Training**
```python
training_config = {
    "learning_rate": 2e-5,
    "batch_size": 16,
    "epochs": 3,
    "validation_split": 0.1
}

fine_tuner.train(config=training_config)
```

**3. Evaluate and Deploy**
```python
# Evaluate on test set
metrics = fine_tuner.evaluate(test_data)

# Deploy custom model
fine_tuner.deploy("my-custom-kubrikai")
```
