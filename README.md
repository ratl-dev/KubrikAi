### What is KubrikAI?

KubrikAI is an advanced language model specifically designed for data operations and SQL intelligence. Built on a sophisticated Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, KubrikAI transforms natural language queries into precise, optimized SQL statements while understanding complex database schemas, business policies, and contextual relationships.

Unlike traditional SQL generators, KubrikAI goes beyond simple translation—it provides intelligent reasoning about your data, suggests optimizations, explains query logic, and ensures compliance with organizational policies.

### Why KubrikAI?

**🎯 Precision & Context**: KubrikAI understands not just what you want to query, but how your data is structured, what business rules apply, and what the most efficient approach would be.

**🧠 Expert Intelligence**: Our MoE architecture routes queries through specialized experts trained on different aspects of data operations—from schema understanding to performance optimization.

**🔒 Policy-Aware**: Built-in governance ensures that generated queries respect data access policies, privacy requirements, and compliance standards.

**🌐 Multi-Database**: Native support for multiple database systems with intelligent adaptation of syntax and optimization strategies.

**📈 Performance-First**: Every query is optimized for performance, considering indexes, query execution plans, and resource utilization.
